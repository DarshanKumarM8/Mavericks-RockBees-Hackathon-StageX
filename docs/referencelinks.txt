1. Biological Research (Apis dorsata Behavior &
Ecology)
Nesting Pattern of Apis dorsata in Urban Environments
● Citation: Wardhe, D.S. & Ghonmode, S.V. (2024). Nesting pattern of Apis dorsata F. in
urban Nagpur. Entomon, 49(4): 539-544.
● Relevance: Establishes the "Urban Cliff" hypothesis and the bees' preference for
high-rise buildings and water tanks over trees.
● Link:(https://www.sscnagpur.ac.in/Department/Zoology/NESTING_PATTERN_ENTOMON
_JAN_25.pdf)
Migration and Philopatry (Site Fidelity)
● Citation: Oldroyd, B.P., et al. (2000). Colony aggregation and seasonal migration in Apis
dorsata.
● Relevance: Scientific proof that Rock Bees return to the exact same nesting sites year
after year, validating the "Migratory Map" feature.
● Link: https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/95/2/119/2187503 (Related genetic study
by Paar et al., 2004)
Shimmering Defense Behavior (Visual Signals)
● Citation: Kastberger, G., et al. (2008/2012). Social waves in giant honeybees repel
wasps / The concept of "Special Agents". PLOS ONE.
● Relevance: Details the velocity (0.3–0.5 m/s) and visual triggers of the "shimmering"
wave, used for the Optical Flow algorithm.
● Link: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003141
Acoustic Hissing Signals
● Citation: Wehmann, H., et al. (2015). The Sound and the Fury—Bees Hiss when
Expecting Danger. PLOS ONE.
● Relevance: Defines the spectral signature (broadband noise 400Hz–6kHz) of defensive
hissing used for the audio monitoring module.
● Link: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118708
Visual Triggers for Aggression
● Citation: Vijayan, S., et al. (2022). Defensive shimmering responses in Apis dorsata are
triggered by dark stimuli moving against a bright background. Journal of Experimental
Biology.
● Relevance: Explains why dark objects (cameras/phones) might trigger bees and
validates the safety distance required.

2. Technical & Algorithmic References
Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM)
● Citation: Wu, H.-Y., et al. (2012). Eulerian Video Magnification for Revealing Subtle
Changes in the World. ACM Trans. Graph.
● Relevance: The core computer vision algorithm proposed to detect subtle "shimmering"
movements invisible to the naked eye.
● Link: https://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/
Optical Flow for Motion Detection
● Citation: OpenCV Documentation. Lucas-Kanade / Farneback Optical Flow.
● Relevance: The mobile-optimized alternative to EVM for detecting coherent motion
waves on the hive surface.
● Link: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/dee/tutorial_optical_flow.html
Existing Bee Monitoring Apps (Market Gap Analysis)
● Examples: HiveTracks, BeeScanning.
● Relevance: Shows that current apps focus on Apis mellifera (managed boxes) and lack
features for wild Apis dorsata detection.
